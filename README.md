SQL-Challenge
I was tasked to conduct a research project about people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s using SQL to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
I started by looking at the CSV files to inspect the data, structure, and columns before doing anything else.
The project was broken down into three parts: Data Modelling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis
Using pgAdmin 4 to interact with the Postgres database to create tables, and columns and import the data within the relevant tables for analysis
Once I imported the data in each of the tables correcting any and all syntax errors
I was able to use the data to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram and ERD of the tables using the QuickDBD tool
The next thing I did was to create the table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, composite keys, and any other relevant constraints in the SQL database before I began querying and conducting analysis.
Please see the end results of this challenge and subsequent png, .sql files for details

Note: I used QuickDBD to help visualize the ERD of the table schema. Stackoverflow with syntax errors assistance, pgAdmin 4 documentation before pushing this challenge to my Github repository
